<h1><a name="SECTION001300000000000000000">
A short style guide</a>
</h1>

<p>
It is very important to learn good programming style and every
programming language has its own conventions for writing code and commenting.
There are some basic guidelines common for all languages, but
different languages also add some rules of their
own to these basic guidelines. The most important thing in programming is not
only to write programs that work. It is  self-evident that the program should
work! But that is not enough: the code should be easy to read and maintain,
the names of the procedures should be descriptive, the code should be commented
(not too little but not too much either). Readability is extremely important,
because you might have to return to code you wrote in the past and be able to
understand it, or even more important, someone else should also be able to
read and modify the code you wrote!

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION001310000000000000000">
Procedures and variables</a>
</h1>

<p>
Procedures should be compact and easy to understand. If a procedure tends to
get very long, you should probably try to think of a way to divide the 
procedure into different parts.

</p><p>
Procedures should be given descriptive names, which indicate what the
procedure does. Try to avoid names that are (too) short.
For example, a procedure for squaring its arguments could be
named <i>square</i> or <i>sq</i>. It might seem very funny in the beginning
to name the procedures after your favourite cartoon character, but in the long
run you will only get angry when you cannot remember what the procedure
<i>donald-duck</i> or <i>mickey-mouse</i> does. Note though, that if a 
name is to be divided, it is not divided by an underscore. For example,
you write <tt>for-each</tt> and not <tt>for_each</tt>. Also note that the 
procedure names are written in lower case.

</p><p>
It is a convention in Scheme that predicates end with a
<i>?</i>, such as <tt>null?</tt>, whereas procedures causing mutations end 
with a <i>!</i>, such as <tt>set!</tt>. Procedures causing conversions are
usually written using an arrow from the source to the target, such as in
<tt>vector-&gt;list</tt>.

</p><p>
Variables should be named according to their purpose. Important variables, e.g.
global variables, should be given descriptive names. For example, let's say
that our program needs to maintain the result of a game. An appropriate
name for a variable containing the result is, for example, <i>result</i>. 
If there are several results that the program needs to maintain, then more
descriptive names should naturally be chosen.
Local variables need not necessarily be given descriptive names. If the 
meaning of the variable can be understood from the context of the program, 
then one character
is usually enough. For example, the letters <i>i</i>, <i>j</i> and 
<i>k</i> are commonly used as indexes or counters.

</p><p>
The code should be written and commented using one language, preferably the 
same language as the keywords of the programming language (read: English!!!).

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION001320000000000000000">
Indentation, newlines and spaces</a>
</h1>

<p>
Even if the interpreter or compiler doesn't care what your programs look like,
people reading it do and therefore you should too. Remember that you might have
to return to your code yourself in the future...Fortunately, there are
editors like Emacs that do most of the work for us, or at least the 
indentation part. For example, see for yourself which procedure is the nicest 
one to look at and the easiest one to read:
</p><pre>(define fact1 (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact1 (- n 1))))))

(define fact2
(lambda (n)
(if (= n 0)
1
(* n (fact2 (- n 1))))))

( define fact3
  ( lambda ( n )
     ( if ( = n 0 )
          1
          ( * n ( fact3 ( - n 1 ) ) )
     )
   )
)

(define fact4
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0)
        1
        (* n (fact4 (- n 1))))))
</pre> 

<p>
Clearly, <i>fact4</i> is the best alternative of them all. This becomes more
obvious as the procedures keep getting more complex!

</p><p>
The amount of spaces when indentating is important in Scheme and the 
normal number of spaces is two, as in <i>fact4</i> in the example above.
The other important thing to remeber is not to put in spaces or newlines where 
they are unneccessary, like they are in the procedure 
<i>fact3</i><a name="tex2html18" href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/Studies/T-93.210/schemetutorial/footnode.html#foot2258"><sup>11.1</sup></a>. Don't  place the parentheses separately 
from the code either--a closing parenthesis should never be left alone
dangling somewhere! Keep the parentheses together!

</p><p>
Also try to avoid very long lines of code. The line should never exceed 
80&nbsp;characters!

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION001330000000000000000">
Commenting the code</a>
</h1>

<p>
Comments should describe what the program does and why, but should not 
describe what the different language features do. You should assume that 
someone reading the code already knows Scheme. Comments start with a 
<tt>;</tt> and continue until the end of the line. 

</p><p>
Comments describing procedures usually start with two  semicolons! For example:

</p><p>
</p><pre>;; square takes a number as an argument and returns its square
(define square
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
If you need to comment something in the middle of the code, you should
not place the comment within the procedure, because it destroys the
readability of your code. It might be better to split the code into
smaller procedures.  In some cases, when you need to comment inner
procedures, you are allowed to break this rule if it is necessary,
but try to avoid it. Try to keep the comment short and indent it
properly.  Otherwise, if  the comment appears in the middle of a
procedure, it should be placed after  the thing you wish to address,
otherwise it should be placed  before. Only one semicolon is needed
for comments within procedures. If the  rest of the line is not
enough, don't let the sentence continue breaking the code. Continue on
the next line after the code sequence, again starting with a semicolon
and continuing your sentence. This is also for the sake of
readability!  For example:

</p><p>
</p><pre>;; The procedure fact takes a number as an argument and returns the 
;; factorial of that number
(define fact
  (lambda (n) 
    (if (= n 0)                 ; the sentence starts here
        1                       ; and, if needed, continues like this
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
</pre>

<p>
Procedures should not be commented like this:
</p><pre>;; fact takes a number as an argument and returns its factorial
(define fact
; One stupid comment on the wrong place
  (lambda (n) 
  ; Another comment destroying readability
    (if (= n 0)                 
        1 			
        (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, placing comments where they don't belong destroys the 
readability of the procedure!

</p><p>
Programs consisting of several entities should usually start with a 
description of the program. In this situation, three semicolons are usually 
used, for example:
</p><pre>;;; This file contains an implementation of the moody evaluator, 
;;; which is a meta-circular evaluator which might evaluate your 
;;; expressions correctly - at least if it is sober and in a good 
;;; mood. Bla bla bla...


;; The procedure fact takes a number as an argument and returns 
;; the factorial of that number
(define fact
  (lambda (n) 
    (if (= n 0)                 
        1 			
        (* n (fact (- n 1)))))) 

;; The procedure eval ...
;; blabla...
(define eval
  (lambda (exp env)  ; blabla
     ...
</pre>

<p>
There are <b>never</b> situations where more than three or four semicolons 
are needed. Don't overdo your comments. Comments should not occupy more 
space than the procedure itself. For example, <b>don't ever</b> comment 
like this:
</p><pre>;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;; A procedure for squaring its argument
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(define sq
  (lambda (x)
    (* x x)))
</pre>

<p>
It is not only ugly, it is extremely ridiculous! Instead of reading a comment
describing a procedure you will have to search for the procedures somewhere
among the comments. This is very annoying.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION001340000000000000000">
The big picture</a>
</h1>

<p>
We will take a look at a larger example in order to get a better feel for 
what good programming style is all about. The following example does not
follow the rules given in this tutorial completely. It might not always be
possible to follow all the golden rules and it is all right to break them once
in a while, as long as it is done in a consistent and sensible way. You still
have to make sure that your code is readable!
